                Token talk is an anonymous message board where viewing certain boards requires cryptographic proof that
                you hold certain ERC20 tokens, ETH, or really anything out of a smart contract.

                        <b style="color:red;">This is beta software!</b> While we do put great emhpasis on security, there are always risks. 
                        If the website or the metamask extension seems strange, requests payment (even a 0 ETH transaction, <u>we will not request you to send any kind of transaction</u>, only sign messages), or 
                        does anything out of what you're used to, it's best to stop using this website.
